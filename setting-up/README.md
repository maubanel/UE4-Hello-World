<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/1000x4/45D7CA/45D7CA" alt="drawing" height="4px"/>


This is a follow up to the introductory Unreal tutorial *Your First Hour in Unreal Engine 4* that will put more of the basics into practice. twist on the usual **Hello World** tutorial which is printing words to a console to introduce someone to a new language.  Since Unreal Engine 4 combines logic, 3-D graphics and a sophisticated editor - this is a multi-disciplinary exercise.  This just introduces creating and importing a 3-D assets, creating a material and material instance and creating logic for a revolving camera. This will give you a start so that you can create your own unique version like the one below.

| :floppy_disk: &nbsp;&nbsp;You will need to install the latest version of _UE4 4.26.x_ by downloading the [Epic Games Launcher](https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/download). You will also need a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account which is free to sign up for as we will be using version control. You will also need a **Mac** or **PC** that is powerful enough to run **Unreal**. If you are on a PC you will have to download and install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (on a mac it may prompt you to install git as well but you can do it through the terminal). For those who don't like command line, will also install [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) as it provides a GUI interface so you don't have to worry about remembering all the git syntax. Once git is installed you will also need to download and install the [Git LFS (Large File System)](https://git-lfs.github.com) as well for both PC and mac.  For this simple introduction that is all that is needed. |
