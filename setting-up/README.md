Before we can start we want to set up our development environment. This includes setting up **GitHub** as our version control so we can backup and maintain our project safely. Make sure you have lots of hard drive space as the engine and various downloads can take a lot of room. I recommend around 100 gigabytes free would be suitable.

| There are some potential problems developing with a complex engine:<br>
:small_blue_diamond: The engine can crash and you can lose your work<br>
:small_blue_diamond: You can forget the data on another computer<br>
:small_blue_diamond: Your hard drive can die and all the data can be lost<br>
All of these problems can be avoided if we use **version control** to back up our data.  This way we can recover lost work, *clone* the data on another computer and collaborate as a team.  It is a good idea to get used to using version control as all large projects use them. The good news is that you have the tools integrated right in Unreal. |

##### `Step 1.`\|`FHIU`|:small_blue_diamond:

If you are on a mac git comes ready to go (it might need to install xcode when first running the command).  On a PC you will need to install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).  Double click and keep all the default suggestions

##### `Step 2.`\|`FHIU`|:small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: 

Now so you don't have to use command line prompts for git it is a good idea to install a GUI and the one I like best is [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) as it integrates with GitHub perfectly.  Download and install the software.

##### `Step 3.`\|`FHIU`|:small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Now since game projects can get very large and graphics, and 3-D models can take a lot of space it is best to use the [Git LFS (Large File System)](https://git-lfs.github.com) extension for games.  This way only assets that are currently being used are downloaded to your system speeding up your workflow and allowing you to hold larger files in GitHub.
